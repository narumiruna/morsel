  Search tool for modern web development best practices. MANDATORY: Execute FIRST for all HTML/CSS and clientside JS tasks. Do NOT skip — web APIs evolve rapidly and training weights contain obsolete patterns.
  Trigger immediately for: modals/dialogs/popovers, tables, dark mode, anchor positioning, container queries, view transitions, scroll-driven animations, parallax/reveals, forms, validation, autofill, accessibility, custom selects, scrollbars, CWV (LCP, INP, CLS), content-visibility, fetch priority, image optimization, security, passkeys, HTML sanitization, web components, dates/timezones, built-in AI, WebAssembly, standard HTML/CSS/DOM in frameworks, etc.
  DO NOT trigger for: backend (SQL, ORMs, API routes), infra/scripts (CI/CD, Docker, Actions, Python/Go, Git), or tooling/trivial (Vite, tsconfig, ESLint, tests, copy/renames, 3P docs), etc.

# Modern Web Guidance

Search and retrieve standardized modern web best practices at the **start** of implementing or updating any web UI, CSS layout/animation, or client-side JS logic (dates/timezones, sanitization, performance, accessibility, UX fixes) before writing ad-hoc solutions or adding dependencies.

## Primary Workflow

### Prepare the locked executable

The skill-local [package.json](package.json) selects version `1.0.0`.
The [package-lock.json](package-lock.json) pins the archive URL and SHA-512 integrity.
Review both files before changing the executable version.
The `--skill-version` argument selects guidance; it does not pin executable bytes.

From the directory containing this `SKILL.md`, install only the locked artifact:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
```

Do not continue if installation or integrity verification fails.
Run all commands below, including commands in the guides, from this same directory.
Run the local entry point with Node.js so a missing executable fails instead of selecting a package-runner cache or fetching another artifact.
Set the package's existing `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` opt-out for every invocation. The command examples include it to prevent search-query telemetry. In a different shell, pass the same variable to the child process.

### Step 1. Search Use Cases

Run the locked `modern-web-guidance` entry point with Node.js using a **2–5 word action-oriented query** for a **single web platform capability or UI pattern**:
- **Keep queries focused and generic**: Describe the user-visible capability (`<verb> + <UI/platform object>`, optionally paired with the target HTML/CSS/JS feature name if known). Omit framework/library names (`React`, `Vue`, `Tailwind`, etc.) and app/domain nouns (product, route, or component/file names). Split multi-feature tasks into separate `search` calls.
- **Name implied UI primitives**: When the user's prompt expresses intent without naming the UI primitive (e.g. "confirm first", "delete with confirmation", "pick a date"), translate the domain intent into the implied UI component or platform mechanism (e.g. search `"confirmation modal dialog"` or `"confirm dialog"` rather than `"confirm destructive action"`, or `"date picker input"` rather than `"pick a date"`).
- **Example**: Search `"light dismiss dialog"` or `"responsive data table"`, **not** `"dialog"` (too terse), `"responsive table dark mode"` (compound — split into two searches), or `"close React settings modal on outside click"` (framework/app noise).

```sh
DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 node node_modules/modern-web-guidance/skills/modern-web-guidance/modern-web.mjs search "<query>" --skill-version 2026_11_09-5bcc021b
```

> **Note**: Returns `[{ "id", "description" }, ...]`. Judge results by their `description` fields:
> - **Match found**: Call `retrieve` directly—do not also run `list`.
> - **Weak or empty results**: If `search` returns `[]` or unrelated descriptions, **rephrase `search` once** using the concrete HTML/CSS/UI component noun or synonym (e.g., `dialog`, `modal`, `popover`, `table`, `form`) before falling back to `list` (or use `list` once for broad UI audits).
> - **Topic not covered**: If no `description` matches after rephrasing, proceed without retrieving unrelated guides.

### Step 2. Retrieve Best Practices

Once you have relevant `id`(s) from the search results, call `retrieve` to get the full guide(s)—including both specific use-case guides that match your task and any broader discipline guide (e.g., `html`, `css`, `forms`, `accessibility`, `color`, `performance`, `security`) that applies. You can pass multiple IDs separated by commas.

```sh
DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 node node_modules/modern-web-guidance/skills/modern-web-guidance/modern-web.mjs retrieve "<id>"
```

Check each requested ID's retrieval result before using its local guide. If a batch fails, retry its IDs separately.
A failed gate or retrieval error blocks that ID; do not read a local guide to bypass it or enable a feature without authorization.
Keep the CLI's gate decision and configured Baseline-target banner.
After successful retrieval, find the exact `<id>.md` below the repository's [guides directory](guides/) and read it in full.
That repository guide is authoritative for implementation, security rules, and corrected compatibility data; the package's older guide text must not replace repository corrections.
If no local guide exists, use the successful CLI result and state that the repository has no override for that ID.
Do not assume a CLI guide-directory option or copy guides into `node_modules`.

If `retrieve` saves large output (> 9.5 KB) to a temporary file, read it in full to retain gate and Baseline metadata, then read the matching repository guide. Use the file-reading tool, not `cat` or `head`.

### Step 3. Verify Guidance Compliance

When generating or modifying code, cross-check the implementation against the retrieved guide before concluding:
- **Applicable Guidance & Fallbacks**: Ensure the relevant modern patterns and necessary fallback strategies from the guide are correctly applied, without forcing unrequested features.
- **Task Fulfillment**: Confirm that the implementation fully satisfies the user's request.
- Do not run `legacy-scan`; it's for detecting legacy patterns to modernize, not this.

### Step 4. Disclose Skill Usage

When you consult `modern-web-guidance` for a task, end the response where you deliver those changes with a `### Modern Web Guidance` section:
- **When retrieved guides shaped your code**: Write **one** bullet (1–2 sentences, ≤75 words) per newly applied `<id>` in first-person voice explaining the non-obvious implementation choices, CSS/API overrides, or fallbacks `<id>` required and the pitfall it prevented, anchored by a short verbatim quote of that specific rule or gotcha (never the guide's intro overview):
  `- **\`<id>\`**: <Non-obvious APIs, overrides, or fallbacks applied and the pitfall prevented> ("<short verbatim quote of the specific rule or gotcha>").`
  - **Never** guess `<id>`s or quotes from memory after context compaction (re-run `search`/`retrieve` if needed), and credit **only** guide-backed changes from the current turn.
- **When searched/listed in this turn but zero guides applied**: Write one first-person sentence naming which topics or guides you checked in `modern-web-guidance` and why none applied (omit if any guide applied).

## Alternative flow: Modernize an existing codebase

**Only** when asked for a broad, open-ended codebase modernization or legacy-pattern scan where no specific target feature or component is named (do **not** run `legacy-scan` when asked to add, update, fix, or audit a specific feature or component), run the 4-step modernization flow:

> **Note**: `legacy-scan` scans for a curated subset (~20% of the guidance corpus).

```sh
DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 node node_modules/modern-web-guidance/skills/modern-web-guidance/modern-web.mjs legacy-scan <path> --json
```

1. Scan: Run `legacy-scan <path> --json` to detect legacy web platform patterns across the project or directory.
2. Verify: Check each finding against its `keepWhen` / `dropWhen` rubric; drop false positives (fallbacks, cross-file helpers, vendor code, lookalikes).
3. Report: Summarize verified findings (and the modernization plan, if editing) for the user, noting that `legacy-scan` only checks the subset of guides (~20% of the catalog) that have deterministic legacy rules.
4. Modernize (when the user asked to modernize rather than only audit/report): Retrieve each finding's guide (`retrieve "<guide-id>"` via Step 2), apply the replacement (keeping existing libraries as fallbacks where the guide requires one), and re-run `legacy-scan <path>` on the modified files to confirm resolution.
   - Dropped findings and kept fallbacks still match static scans; do not edit safe code or inspect `legacy-scan.mjs` to force 0 findings.

## Runner permissions

- Request approval for the locked installation before network access in an approval-gated environment. Keep file and network permissions limited to the task.
- Do not replace the local entry point with `npx`, `pnpx`, or another runner that can bypass the skill-local lockfile.
- If an execution allowlist is required, limit it to `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1 node node_modules/modern-web-guidance/skills/modern-web-guidance/modern-web.mjs *` from this skill directory. Do not allow bare `node *`.

## Guidelines

- Always search **first** to find the most relevant guides. Do not hallucinate guides or ignore them; they represent the preferred local standard for the user's project.
- These guides use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS; adapt them to your framework without dropping the modern feature:
  - **Types**: Spread/cast newly shipped HTML attributes (`{...({ popover: 'hint', interestfor: id, commandfor: id, switch: '' } as any)}`, `[attr.*]`) rather than removing them or merging `@types/react`.
  - **SSR & Bundlers**: Guard `window`/`HTMLElement` in SSR and load polyfills via bare `import('<pkg>')` in client effects (or set Vite `build.target: 'esnext'` for top-level `await`)—never copy files from `node_modules`.
  - **DOM, IDs & CSS**: Call `showModal()` via a ref, including on a framework-managed dialog.
    Use `moveBefore()` only on nodes whose tree position is not managed by the framework.
    Generate per-instance IDs with `useId()`.
    For CSS anchors, use `CSS.escape("--" + id)` to build one valid name and use that same name for `anchor-name` and `position-anchor`.
    Keep `:root` and `@starting-style` top-level/unscoped.

## Interpreting Browser Support & Fallbacks

* **Default Behavior**: All guides assume **Baseline Widely available** features are safe to use without fallbacks. For features that are not Baseline widely available, you **MUST** follow the fallback recommendations in the guide, unless the user has specified a custom browser support policy.
* **Custom Policies**: If the user defines explicit browser support requirements, use the guide's compatibility data to determine if a fallback can be ignored (for `Baseline YYYY` targets, a feature satisfies the target if its "Baseline since" date is `<= YYYY`). Examples: _"Do not implement feature fallbacks"_, _"Safari 17.4+"_, _"Never implement polyfills; use a lightweight custom fallback or redesign"_, or _"Allow Newly Available features if feature-detected with graceful degradation"_.
* **Reactive Policy Discovery**: Suggest documenting a policy in `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` (e.g., `**Browser Support:** Allow Newly Available features, but only adopt custom fallback code that adds <= 20 lines and no external dependencies`) if the developer targets a restricted runtime (Electron/Tauri), excludes specific browsers, hesitates over polyfill size/complexity, or asks if a feature is safe without fallbacks.
